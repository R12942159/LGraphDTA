### Data
Our supplementary data, including the protein features with ESM2 embeddings, exceeds the submission file size limit. Since these embeddings are too large to be included directly, we have provided access to the data via an anonymized Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SETWxlQope1QwdPlR8ghhmgsN2myaIL-/view?usp=drive_link
